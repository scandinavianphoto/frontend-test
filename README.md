# Task 
Create a basic web page using HTML/CSS/Javascript that displays information about Game of Thrones.

Spend some time making it look like you want, but focus on making the information easy to parse and the application easy to use. 
Creative and fun solutions is always appreciated, have fun creating!

These three features should be implemented: 
* List all the GoT's Houses by name. Use "An API of Ice And Fire" for this. The following GET request will retrieve a list of all houses https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses. Read the full documentation for the API here: https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/Documentation
* When clicking on a House in the list, additional information should be displayed. The user should also be able to hide this information again. You can pick a couple of properties to show based on what you get from the API.
* The user should be able to search to filter the Houses.

# Setup
Create your own project from scratch or clone this and use as a base, if you choose to clone this one you will need to install Node.js.
You can then execute npm start in your terminal while inside the project directory to launch the application in the web with auto refresh when you save file changes.

# Delivery
* Send in the code as a link to github (public repo, without the node_modules directory). 
 * The app should come with clear and simple instructions for how to run it.

You are allowed to use any frameworks/libraries you want. That said, extensive use of frameworks and libraries will, of course, make it harder for us to evaluate your solution.
